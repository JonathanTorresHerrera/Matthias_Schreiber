        <h2>Attention Career Shifters!</h2>

          Fast track your Python Programming Career! Whether you are new or a
          Python programmer now, leading expert will help you quickly advance

        </h3>
        <p>
          I know what it feels like to be stuck in a job you dislike..Some of
          the jobs I had didn’t pay me well, others had little training, poor
          leadership and even toxic work environments. For a long time I blamed
          my circumstances. But deep inside I knew changing things was all on
          me. But how could I start? What could I do? Even though I had figured
          out that I needed to change, I had no idea how. For a long time I
          wanted to become a freelancer, to live and work on my own terms, but
          had no idea where to begin. When the boss reneged on my raise twice, I
          finally had enough. I went on a mission to improve my life and become
          a Freelance programmer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I finally found an answer! Now after more than ten years of pure job
          satisfaction and making a great living, I want to share the secrets
          that helped me quickly change my life. I’m Matthias, former employee,
          then freelancer and now full-time mentor. After scouring the web and
          struggling through numerous tutorials and trying instructors who
          became impatient with me, I knew there had to be a better way to learn
          programming. I understand how you could be experiencing the same
          frustration. But you don’t have to. I can help you start your dream
          career without the struggle and get paid what you are worth. I have
          tailored a solution for you. In my breakthrough mentor program, I will
          take you from your current level of knowledge even if you are a
          beginner to programming mastery so you can make the big bucks and be
          happy! After years of learning and development, I have created the
          bullet proof learning systems to accelerate your career. I had to
          sacrifice a lot of my time with my wife and I’m so grateful that she
          supported me all the way. I took my little notepad everywhere with me
          to write down ideas or plans. I had countless calls with my assistant
          and my mentor to get this course just perfect. All of this grueling,
          hard and long work in pursuit of creating a truly valuable and
          personal learning experience for you has paid off.

        <h2>There is nothing like the Python Mentor Program in the world!</h2>
        <p>
          You get live personal mentoring where you can ask all the questions
          you have in each session. There is also a discord group where the
          whole community supports you (and you are expected to support others
          too). You can study with like-minded people.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="section-3-h3">This is so Easy!</h3>
        <p>
          Learning with a live instructor has proven to be faster and have a
          higher comprehension rate than sitting through video after video. You
          will look forward to each exciting session and complete your training
          at your own pace. Start your first session now and in no time you can
          go for your dream job or even the stars.
